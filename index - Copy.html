                        **Adventures in Computing**
                           Version 2.0


A journal of my discoveries, enlightenments, and occasional frustrations as a long-time geek.

2020-02-23: Gitpod
==============================================================

I have been programming in Java since 1997, initially using JBuilder (as I recall). I have been working with Eclipse since the early 2000s, especially in the context of my Teximus software startup.  There, we used Ant extensively to automate our build chain. 

When I started work on [OWLCMS](https://owlcms.github.io/owlcms4/#/index) in 2009, I learned Maven.  But creating an environment with SVN, then Mercury, then GIT, Maven, and a bunch of utilities was a real mess.

Fast-forward to 2019.  Git has won the war, and most OSS projects are on Github.  But setting up an Eclipse with all the stuff needed for Git and Maven to work correctly is still a daunting affair.  Something like a good day's work. Enter [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io).  It provides a Docker container that runs a Web-based version of Eclipse called Theia with all the Java goodies available, plus Maven and Git integration.  Theia is actually a cousin of Visual Studio Code -- visually they are strikingly similar, and Theia runs all the VSCode extensions.  I can't actually differentiate VSCode (which I use locally for Go programming) and Theia on Gitpod.

The nice thing: I now have a cloud-based version of my development environment in a matter of minutes.  See [this walkthrough](https://jflamy-dev.github.io/owlcms4-prerelease/#/Gitpod) for an example.



2020-02-20: Adventures in Computing Redux
==============================================================

I used to hold a public journal where all my quirky discoveries about programming, software configuration and other propeller-head fun would be logged.
This is an attempt at relaunching this in the modern age.
