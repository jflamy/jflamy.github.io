It's been over a year since my last blog update, and there's been significant progress on the OWLCMS project during this time. Here are some highlights of what's been happening in the world of Olympic Weightlifting Competition Management System.

## Project Evolution

The OWLCMS project continues to evolve and adapt to the needs of the weightlifting community. Since retiring from consulting in 2023, I've been able to dedicate more focused time to improving the system and responding to user feedback from competitions around the world.

## Community Feedback

The feedback from the weightlifting community has been invaluable in shaping the direction of OWLCMS. Whether it's requests for new features, bug reports, or suggestions for improvements, the community input continues to drive the development priorities.

## Looking Forward

As we move forward, the focus remains on making OWLCMS the most reliable and user-friendly competition management system for Olympic weightlifting. The combination of Vaadin's robust framework and the flexibility of modern web technologies continues to serve the project well.
