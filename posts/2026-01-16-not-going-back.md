# Using AI Assistance in Coding, follow-up

*Posted on January 16, 2026*

Well, I'm not going back.  Instead of a solo developer, I'm back to being a team lead.
But my junior colleagues are now LLMs.  I have litterally not written a line of code in the
last 3 months (but I did read a fair bit and tweaked some).

The best analogy I can come up with is why would you use a hand drill when there is an an electric one?
Basically doing work somewhere like a cabin where there is no electricity.  This said, master cabinet
makers can still use a chisel and a handsaw when required.

Using LLMs has allowed me to deliver things that I would not have done otherwise
- [owlcms-tracker](https://github.com/owlcms/owlcms-tracker?tab=readme-ov-file#owlcms-tracker) is written as a SvelteKit/Node.js application.
Well, I don't know either. I mean, I know a lot about web applications, but not the details of either.  The premise to this project was
that anyone could use an AI Agent to get a scoreboard or document with the look they wanted, with no programming.
So I took it upon myself to do exactly that, and I was vindicated when someone in Japan did the same.
- [owlcms-controlpanel](https://github.com/owlcms/owlcms-controlpanel) is a Go application.  I had written the original version with AI assistance
because I did not know the intricate details of the Fyne user interface library. But I actually had 3 variants of this application, that I needed
to merge and refactor.  Something I would have kept pushing in the future.
- [owlcms](https://github.com/jflamy/owlcms4) For this one I had the opportunity to create fancy scoreboards for international events. But doing
CSS work is tedious and error prone.  The ability of LLMs to look at images to fix things never ceases to amaze me.

So, yeah, not going back.
