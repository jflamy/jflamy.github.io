# Using AI Assistance in Coding

*Posted on October 3, 2025*

As someone who has been programming since 1977, I've witnessed the evolution of development tools from simple text editors to sophisticated IDEs.

It has been a very interesting experience for me to experience the arrival of Large Language Model (LLM) tools.

I have now, frankly, become dependent on these tools for several tasks:
- Some of the code I write is in languages where I don't know the detailed APIs.  For example, I use GoLang to write programs that have to be compiled for specific architectures.  I don't know the details of how to create user interfaces using the `fyne` library, and it would take forever to read it up and experiment.
- Likewise, I use programs like ffmpeg as submodules, and they have extremely dense and rich parameter sets.
- There are features in my owlcms program I did not dare tackle because I knew there was a
lot of boilerplate, repetitive, error-prone code involved.  I can now get assistance in doing that.
