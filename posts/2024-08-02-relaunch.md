# jflamy.dev relaunch

*Posted on August 2, 2024*

I retired from consulting a year ago, at the end of June 2023. I had been a senior IT manager and a lead IT architect, you can read all about that on my LinkedIn page -- that is pretty much the only reason I still have one. Since then, my brain has been kept quite busy with [owlcms](https://owlcms.jflamy.dev).

This site is an absolutely trivial journal, done using Docsify.

I will try to contribute to it occasionally.
