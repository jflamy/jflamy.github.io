title: Adventures in Computing

Adventures in Computing was the name of my old blog, in the good old days of Teximus.  Teximus (to weave, in Latin) started out as a Knowledge Management company. The [first iteration of the Web site](https://web.archive.org/web/20030604032105/http://www.teximus.com/HomeSection.jsp?instId=198) shows that (too bad I never thought about capturing a proper site walk).  Later, we realized that core knowledge about businesses could also be captured with a much easier ROI in the context of Governance, Risks and Controls (GRC).  But the people who needed us would not buy from us because we were too small.  So eventually we quit while we were ahead.
